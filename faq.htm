   <p><strong>Where can I get help?</strong><br />
     There is no official support for yersinia, but you can try to 
        send an e-mail to yersinia@yersinia.net and wait
        if something happens.

   <p><strong>Where did the name come from?</strong><br />
         No other bacteria, perhaps organism, had so much of an effect on 
         human history as Yersinia pestis, the bacteria that causes plague. 
         Many outbreaks of plague have caused death and population reduction 
         throughout history. The most famous, however, was the notorious Black 
         Death of medeival times that killed one third of the population of 
         14th century Europe. People watched their family and friends die with 
         sickly buboes (swollen lymph nodes) on their necks and a color near 
         black all over their bodies, caused by respiratory failure. People who 
         contracted the disease and were unable to fight it off died within 
         three to five days.

<p><strong>How do you dare to implement a tool for doing nasty things?</strong><br />
      Hey! take it easy. We are pen-testers, so we need this little proggie
         for making chaos in our customers networks. Running yersinia to do "bad things" is not recommended and could cause inestability and 
           serious troubles to your health.</p>
      <br />
        <p><strong>Wtf? This crappy software does not run in Windows.</strong><br />
      No, it does certainly not. Perhaps some nice fellow could port 
         yersinia to Windows and make you happy.</p>
 <br />
 <p><strong>Where can I download yersinia?</strong><br />
      Try http://www.yersinia.net. Downloads section.</p>
<br />
     <p><strong> How can I build yersinia?</strong> <br />
      Do a './configure', and then 'make'</p>
<br />
<p><strong> When will be the 'put_your_preferred_os_here' supported?</strong><br />
      When someone (like you) help us compiling and patching Yersinia</p>
<br />      
 <p><strong> How can I install yersinia?</strong><br />
      Do a 'make install'</p>
  <br />  
<p><strong>I've resized my window and yersinia is displaying crappy data!</strong><br />
      Please press Ctrl+L to clear and refresh the screen</p>
  <br />     
      <p><strong>There are some fields in the packet that don't display their meaning!</strong> <br />
      A: Please, use the best tool for dissecting packets: ethereal.</p>

       <p><strong>I'm unable to switch between different protocol windows!!</strong><br />
      To switch between protocol windows you must use the function keys.
         Unfortunately the way function keys works is different with different
         terminal emulations. If you have problems with the function keys
         enable some other function keys emulation in your client terminal
         software, e.g.: On PuTTY select Terminal -&gt; Keyboard and mark "The
          Function Keys and keypad" as "Xterm R6".</p>

	<p><strong>Why the hell the ncurses interface has a lot more options than the
          Cisco interface?</strong> <br />
      Man... we are developing this proggy out of work time, it's just a
  matter of time... Anyway you can try to help us... :)</p>
  <br />
      <p><strong> Arrgggghhh!!! The proggy crashes 'ad infinitum', is this a f*ck*n'
      sh*t?</strong><br />
      First of all thanks a lot for your invaluable opinion... :-P
  On the other hand, we are *NOT* professional developers... By the way,
  have you noticed the proggy version (0.5.x)? :-P
  Anyway you can send us a patch solving the problem and you will get
  your 5 minutes of fame... :D</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Who are you?</strong><br /> 
    A couple of good friends and coworkers who enjoy a lot to play within
    the network security field. By the way we like a lot the spanish food.
    :D.</p>
 <br />
<p><strong>You are so handsome!!! I want to meet you in real life.</strong><br />
    Girls are welcome. But take into account the following sentence:
    'If you spend more time sharpening your axe, you'll spend less time 
    chopping wood'</p>
